## How to Use

### 1. Download the HTML File

To use the signature, download the raw HTML file directly from the repository.

### 2. Edit the HTML File

Before opening the file, it's important to update the signature with your own information. You can do this by editing the downloaded `signature.html` file in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

Look for the following sections and replace the placeholder information:
- **Profile picture URL**: Update the `<img>` tag with the URL to your own profile image.
- **Name**: Change the `strong` tag (currently "Nolan Olhausen") to your own name.
- **Position**: Update the position text (currently "Full-Stack Developer") to your own job title or role.
- **Links**: Replace the links to your own (currently has phone, website, LinkedIn, Github).
- **Icons**: Replace the img links with your own.

Feel free to make any additional adjustments to the design, text, or color scheme.

### 3. Open the HTML File

After editing, save the file and open it in your browser.

### 4. Copy the Signature

Once the file is opened in your browser, select all the content on the page (you can use `Ctrl + A` on Windows or `Cmd + A` on macOS) and copy it to your clipboard (`Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C`).

### 5. Add the Signature in Gmail

1. Go to your Gmail inbox.
2. Click the gear icon in the top-right corner and select **See all settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Signature** section.
4. Paste the copied signature content into the signature box (`Ctrl + V` or `Cmd + V`).
